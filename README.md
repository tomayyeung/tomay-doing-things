This is my repo for random projects I have in Python. Feel free to take a look around. :)

## soccer.py
- Simple soccer game using Pygame
- Click and drag to aim, release to fire
- Powerups
  - Grenade
- To add:
  - Appearance customization
  - Powerup to make one player heavier for a round
  - Powerup to make the field in an area slippery (?)
